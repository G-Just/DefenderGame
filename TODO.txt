Need to implement UI where weapons can be displayed.
    When hovering weapons display range + stats of the weapons
    Maybe show the comedown until the next shot.

New upgrades:
    Repair wall,
    Bouncing projectiles?

New weapon:
    Some kind of weapon that slows the movement speed of the enemy,

Add images to upgrade cards

New Features:
    Maybe status effects?

General gameplay:
    Progression? maybe add waves

Enemies:
    Add more interesting enemies:
        enemy that zig-zags
        suicide bomber enemy -> 1hp runs to the wall and dies -> does high dmg
